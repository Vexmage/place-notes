# 📍 PlaceNotes — Location-Based Notes & AR Prototype

**PlaceNotes** is an experimental React Native + Expo project exploring how people can leave digital notes, memories, jokes, or graffiti *anchored to real-world locations*.

---

## ✨ MVP Focus

- 📌 **Dropping notes at your current GPS location**
- 🗺️ **Viewing notes on an interactive map**
- 📱 **A clean mobile UI built with Expo and React Navigation**
- 📍 **Precise device geolocation via `expo-location`**

Future versions will introduce **augmented reality features** where users can aim their phone at a wall or object and see notes “attached” to the physical world — a lightweight spatial AR experience.

---

## 🎯 Project Goals

- Build a working **React Native geolocation + mapping application**
- Create a minimal backend for **saving, loading, and filtering notes**
- Demonstrate early AR concepts (**floating notes**, **directional AR view**)
- Evolve into a real AR prototype using **ARCore / ARKit**

This project serves as:

- a **portfolio piece** showcasing mobile, mapping, and AR capability  
- a foundation for **advanced AR spatial anchoring**  
- an experiment in **digital place-based storytelling**

---

## 🛠️ Current Tech Stack

- **React Native (Expo)**
- **React Navigation**
- **react-native-maps**
- **expo-location**
- **JavaScript / TypeScript support**
- *(Planned)* **Firebase Firestore**
- *(Planned)* **ARCore / ARKit**

## 🚧 MVP Status

- ✔ Navigation scaffold  
- ✔ Project structure  
- ✔ Map screen placeholder  
- ✔ Location hook implemented  
- ⏳ Next: Rendering a live map with user location
